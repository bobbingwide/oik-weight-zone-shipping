	/**
	 * Unit test calculate_shipping
	 *
	 * This is what I wanted to do...
	 * - Start a new instance. How do we find the instance ID? 
	 * - Confirm we're using "oik_weight_zone_shipping" - for oik-weight-zone-shipping not oik-weightcountry-shipping
	 * - Confirm it's enabled
	 * - Create a package to pass
	 * - Calculate shipping
	 *
	 * This is the pragmatic solution, using live data from qw/wordpress
	 * Not really good enough but it will do until we can generate it dynamically.
	 * 
	 * Notes:
	 * - The shipping methods that are loaded depend on the Zone for the package.
	 * - The destination defaults to UK since that is the value for user 0 ( taken from customer billing/shipping address)
	 * - One product weighs 0.1 kg.
	 * - Two products weigh 0.2 kg.
